02 HTML CSS Make a Project Website
Purpose: The main goal of this project was to make a website that hosts all the projects I will do in this course. I was able to complete somewhat of a skeleton of this website,
and added some placeholders for where I can host my projects in the future. This assignment, although complete, is definitely still a work in progress.

What I did:
1. I created a boiler plate HTML file, and added a bunch of different divs to host different aspects of the website.
2. I created a wireframe to help me create the boiler plate HTML file.
3. Utilized the root file to change all the fonts on my page.
4. Created a navigation bar, just not fully functional yet because it doesn't link directly to the parts of the page. 
5. Used Flexbox to create my work tab, and created a border around my work tab to host all my work inside of it. 
6. Linked my email by using the mailto function on HTML.
